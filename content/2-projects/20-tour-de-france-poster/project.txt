Travelling through intimidating mountains, peaceful fields, and harsh terrains, the Tour de France is the most renowned cycling competition in the worldâ€¦ and the most complex.

The task was to present a large amount of complex information regarding the Tour de France in manageable, organized chunks. Conclusively, this was developed as a pullout poster for the National Geographic magazine, in which the viewer would unfold the multiple panels to reveal a large piece of information design.
	
The information presented within the poster was the most important aspect of it, and therefore had to be designed to seem uncomplicated and digestible. By using engaging diagrams, easy-to-follow graphs, and special emphasis on specific facts and figures, data and details are exhibited in a manner that aids the viewer to understand the particulars of the Tour. Colour is used sparingly yet judiciously, and certain typefaces used amplify and differentiate between areas.
