Opposing forces, clashing ideals, opponents throughout history… one could say French and English — pardon the writer, British — are polar opposites. Combining cultures, what would the ideas resemble? Scotland meets Québec; that is exactly what Timm & OutLaws aims to achieve with their products, modern casual-chic clothing and accessories for men.
	
Appealing to the slightly more playful and casual side of sophistication, the Timm & OutLaws brand was in need of an identity that accurately portrayed them. Conceptually, the goal was to always return to the idea of “opposing natures.” This was achieved through colour selection (gold and silver), typographic combination (the elegant and classic Sabon versus the more textural Le Corbusier), and use of symbol (the small x placed on the expansive background). The abstract patterning was devised from the cross-hatching found in the logo.
