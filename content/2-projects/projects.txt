Title: Projects

Textmain: Many of the projects below were completed as part of a team working with (link: http://customfitonline.com text: Custom Fit Online), and the roles of others are included. My contributions and those of others are included within project descriptions. A couple of these projects are incomplete; I am currently in the process of adding new images and descriptions (probably right now as you are reading this!), so I apologize for any page that seems “too short.”

The following projects are work that I am excited about, however they haven’t had case studies built around them like the previous projects have. View them if the previous eight weren’t enough.

## Non-Shipped Projects

Sometimes, projects are started but not pushed into the real-world. There can be many reasons for this: maybe the client has decided to postpone redesigns, or maybe internal problems led to contract terminations. These project have not shipped, but I consider my role in them noteworthy, and I am proud of my contributions to the project, even if they weren’t selected as final products.
