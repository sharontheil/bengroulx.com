The Pacific Northwest Kermode bear, otherwise known famously as the spirit bear, is a majestic beast that roams the upper forests of British Columbia. *Kermōd* is a new, up-and-coming men’s cleaning supply shop, opening stores all over Canada. Its focus is on “new beginnings” and environmentalism, concepts both seemingly difficult to convey.

The goal was to create a brand identity for *Kermōd* that relates the company’s products to their ideals; to join nature with cleaners. Through the use of a developed four-step process (layering colour, texture, imagery, and typography), an elegant solution was formed that could be reproduced for the entire company’s materials, from product packaging and collateral to advertising and web design.
