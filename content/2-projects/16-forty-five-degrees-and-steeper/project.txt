According to the license plates, British Columbia has been named “the most beautiful place on Earth”… and appropriately so. Being such a vast land with many completely different and interesting appearances, it is the perfect playground for exploration.

Sam McKoy is a ski / mountain guide in training, but more importantly an adventurer, visiting the tall mountains and low seas, discovering all the beauty the land has to offer. *Forty Five Degrees and Steeper*, titled after Sam’s personal journal, encapsulates his journeys around the province (and even abroad) through his written and photographic works.

The emphasis throughout the book was on Sam’s descriptive writings and incredible photographs that tell the stories of his adventures. The general feel of the book is based on the look of ski patrollers of the world, with a large duotone images in blue as a compliment to the bold first-aid-reds. The grid and layout is inspired by the Swiss style of design.
