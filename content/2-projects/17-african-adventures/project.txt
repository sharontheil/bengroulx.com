East Africa is a realm of utter vastness—and beauty. The landscape, the animals, the the people… all of it an experience worth discovering. Gap Adventures, a travel  company offering unique adventure tours around the world, aims to help everyone encounter a trip of a lifetime.

The task was to create a large informational brochure / guide for Gap Adventures, displaying itineraries, maps, information, and photographs. The inspiration for the brochure came from the tribes of Africa, and how one can belong to a tribe as one would a family. The tribes shown throughout the guide are representations of the Gap Adventure trips, and thus the viewer’s quest to discover which tribe—trip—is the best fit for them. Visually, the familiar patterns and colours so widely associated with their various cultures were used. By using large open areas of whitespace and uncomplicated typography, the focus is explicitly on the patterns, which hold up on their own because of their intricacies, character, and aesthetic flair. Large, expansive photos cover whole pages, bringing viewers directly into the setting.
