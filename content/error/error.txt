Title: Error (404)

Text: 

This is a **404** page. You’re getting this page because the page that was *supposed* was here, actually doesn’t exist. Totally weird, right? Maybe you’d like to head over to the (link: writings text: articles and essays) section? Or you might want to go back to the (link: / text: home page)? If you aren’t finding what you are looking for, or if I can help you out with anything, let me know via Twitter (link: https://twitter.com/bengroulx text: @bengroulx) or email (email: ben@bengroulx.com text: ben@bengroulx.com).

Or you could go listen to some music. In fact, that sounds a lot more fun.
