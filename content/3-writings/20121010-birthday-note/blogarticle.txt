Title: A Birthday Note

----

Text: 

<span id="dropcap">M</span>any people have been asking me what I want for my birthday this week. Don’t get me wrong, I truly appreciate it, but it gets annoyingly repetitive saying, “Oh, no nothing at all” over and over. And really, it’s true, there is nothing I want or need. So instead, here’s my birthday request: if you’d like to gift something (of even if you don’t, you should consider it anyways), please consider donating to a worthy cause. 

If you’d like to donate, here is a short list of some issues that are important to me, where I feel a donation would make a difference. I don’t need a gift… but a lot of other people do, though. Hugs and head pats, all.
