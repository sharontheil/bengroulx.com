	<p><span id="dropcap">I</span>n the wake of the largest celebrity scandal of recent memory, I&rsquo;d like to voice a few comments about how this all unfolded. I don&rsquo;t really have any conclusions&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s not my place <em>to</em> have any&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but I do have some thoughts on how this has developed and about some individual aspects of the situation,  specifically about privacy, objectification, and misogyny.﻿</p>
    <h2>About the women</h2>
    <p>These women are getting a lot of hate because these nude photographs were even taken in the first place. That simple act of taking and possessing nude photographs was, in itself, reason enough for stealing that property.</p>
    <p><em>What</em>?</p>
    <p>How does that make sense? &ldquo;You had a car, therefore you deserved to have it stolen.&rdquo; That is an absurd sentiment. None of the blame should be on these women, who assumed their private collection would be just that: private. Which brings us to cloud servicing.</p>
    <h2>About the cloud</h2>
    <p>As someone who works in the tech industry, I wholly and absolutely understand that once uploaded, files are up for grabs. The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t some magical place where files go to romp with unicorns and dance around rainbows. It&rsquo;s a server, a server that grants access to a huge number of people. Many people don&rsquo;t understand how cloud services work&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or are supposed to work&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and even buy into ridiculous notions of what they can and cannot do (e.g. the movie <em>Sex Tape</em>). I wouldn&rsquo;t pin ignorance on the everyday user, though; Apple (and pretty much every other cloud service out there) touts cloud capabilities as the absolute best thing that has happened to computing: it&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s safe, it&rsquo;s reliable… it just works! When a service is publicized as &ldquo;just working,&rdquo; we expect it to, well, <em>just work</em>. By bombarding users with notions of simplicity, safety, and dependability, they&rsquo;re going to believe it. <em>Why wouldn&rsquo;t my files be safe here?</em></p>
    <p>If Apple truly believes iCloud is a secure environment, then this is a <em>huge</em> breach for them. If they flip the fault on to its users&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;&ldquo;Well, you shouldn&rsquo;t have uploaded your private stuff there in the first place.&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;then they&rsquo;ve been caught in false advertising and could face a massive problem. Either way, it&rsquo;s not looking good for them. I absolutely do not want to diminish the distress of the victims, but this might be a much larger problem that could affect many, many more. <em>(Sidenote: I have a very hard time believing this is actually a breach of iCloud security; I think it could be a problem that is much larger than one company.)</em> So why aren&rsquo;t more news outlets covering our collective security?</p>
    <h2>About the coverage</h2>
    <p>Before I quit checking Facebook, I could sort my connections into two general groups: The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sad Robin Williams died!!! :(&rdquo; group, and the &ldquo;Stop talking about one person!! Look, see ISIS is an <em>actual</em> problem!!!&rdquo; group. You know them. The people who talk about a topical subject, and then the other people who berate the people for not talking about a <em>different</em> topical subject. In this case, I&rsquo;m seeing people fall (generally) into the same two categories again: &ldquo;Oh my god, have you seen the leaked photos?!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why we are you talking about the photos?! Look at this!!!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I think we&rsquo;re focusing on the wrong story. Saying we should or should not be talking about this is a continuation of the problem, the root which lies in our desire to even want this content in the first place. It&rsquo;s a problem that lies in the monetization of sexual objectification.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to make money off the hardships of others, especially the objectification of celebrities. Doubly especially the objectification of female celebrities. I think objectification often even goes further into the abstract: See, the Kardashians aren&rsquo;t <em>people</em>. They&rsquo;re not even <em>things</em>. They&rsquo;re ideas, concepts to help you buy perfume or jerk off to or whatever else. It&rsquo;s sexual objectification in a more-or-less dormant way. I wonder if that is what people say when they hate the Kardashians: not as people, but as abstractions? To me, they are excellent businesspeople who have marketing down pat. I also hold them in a higher regard than most media outlets because they only ever use their own creations as means of gain; it&rsquo;s their own clout driving them forward. Compare that to media outlets who are profiting off the jeopardy of others. And I guess, hypocritically, I normally wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with them doing so with abstractions, but the thing that kept coming back to me in each of these pictures is how <em>ordinary</em> the women looked in every one of their photos. How ordinary their surroundings were. These photos could have been any one of us.</p>
    <p>So how do we fix the media? It comes back to <em>us</em>. I choose to not take the tin-foil hat route: I believe that the media is not an evil, all-encompassing organization out to turn us into mind slaves. Maybe it&rsquo;s naive, but I believe that the media is a business&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and businesses need to make money. They&rsquo;re raking in the dollars by appealing to what their users want, and what we want is more <em>more</em> <strong>more</strong> sex.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the photos were leaked by one guy; if it wasn&rsquo;t him, it would have been someone else. There&rsquo;s an audience for this, and the audience is hungry. And I, too, am part of the audience, and part of the problem.</p>
    <h2>About my own reactions</h2>
    <p>When the photos were first announced, I was indifferent. More nudes, whatever. But as more and more photos&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and names&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;were released, one woman in particular grabbed my attention. I <em>had</em> to see the evidence. That action was quick and automatic, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it okay. Wanting to see those images was an act of objectification that I&rsquo;m not proud of. I&rsquo;m always trying to be a better person&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that&rsquo;s what getting older is&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;which is in part why I am writing this: reflection and examination. I&rsquo;m sorry I contributed to the problem.</p>
    <p>Just last night, before this whole situation began to unfold, Tiarra said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m dating a feminist.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how to respond, because, well, yeah, of course I am. But this shows that despite my best efforts, I still have a ways to go.</p>
    <h2>What did we learn?</h2>
    <p>As I said at the opening, I don&rsquo;t really have any conclusions: just points. There&rsquo;s no final opinion, no deduction. But at the very least, it can help me (and you) think deeper about what we put out into the world. I&rsquo;m not trying to say don&rsquo;t take nude photos&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this isn&rsquo;t really even about photos. Go ahead, take the pictures. We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to do <em>private</em> things in the privacy of our own homes. And further to that, never apologize for doing non-harmful things in the privacy of your own home, and never apologize for being a victim in any situation.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not an expert, and maybe my ramblings are the equivalent of a freshman first learning about Marxism: &ldquo;Capitalism is <em>evil</em>, dude!&rdquo; But I know the photo leak is an absolute horrid invasion of privacy, I know the way this situation has unfolded is deplorable, and I know that this is the result of a much larger problem that leads to everyday sexualization, abuse, and misogyny.</p>
