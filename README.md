I’m teaching myself git — and more specifically, how to use GitHub. So I’ve decided to do the stupid thing and open myself up to embarrassement: I’m open sourcing this whole damn thing. It’s a learning experiment for me. And also, I write some pre’ good HTML and CSS, why not showcase that? (That’s when three hundred engineers rush in and tell me my code is shit. _shrug_)

If you’re interested, please follow along. This is going to be a bumpy ride, but hey, when is it not?  Alright… okay, let’s do this.

Dammit, wait… How do I commit, again?
